## Steps to use application
Some general notes:
```
Due to how the data is managed in the application, if you refresh the page
the application will generally revert back to its original state. Keep this in mind during testing.
For the purposes of testing this application, we will assume that when opening the app you have signed in with an email and password.
For your testing, your initial user account is named as "Olivia." A different user, "JohnTheVet" is also utilized in some places.
```

### Profile Page:
First we'll start with basic profile details
```
first, click on the profile icon on the footer to enter the profile page and view the existing profile
then, use the gear icon in the top right corner to enter your profile settings
here, you can start with changing the username. Enter OliviaLikesPets for example, or Olivia123
then, you can select a location, go ahead and pick British Columbia, though any would work
you don't need to enter a date of birth, but you can if you'd like. 
then, change the About Me to "Hello! I am a pet enthusiast and this is my profile!"
Finally, select the camera icon in the top left and upload a profile picture, any you'd like. Then save your changes. 
```

Now we'll move on to other profile settings. 
```
For privacy settings, you can set them however you'd like. Later in the demo, you'll have a chance to see
a profile that has its "Who Can Message Me" set to friends only, to get an example of how that is handled. 
In notifications, you can keep the values on default.
Since there won't be other users making posts or sales being added while you are testing the app for example, there won't really be new notifications for you to get. 
You will get a chance to see what notifications you would have received.
```
Now for the pet profile!
```
Next, we'll make a pet profile. First, enter a pet name. "Scratch" for example.
If you'd like now, perhaps you "accidentally" click on the return to profile button. See what comes up!
Then, you can skip the extra treat day and select a profile picture for your pet using the camera icon. 
Add an About Me for the pet as well, something like "Scratch is a fun dog who loves to play fetch!"
Then save your changes, and return to your profile. 
```

You can now see your updated profile! Now we'll move on to other sections of the app.
